# ***What is Cyber Security?***
 **_<p>Cyber Security is a collection of processes that protect digital infrastructure and system from external and internal threats and attacks. These offensive actions are known as cyberattacks, which are designated as offensive actions by malicious parties targeted at a computer system with intent of doing so ranging from stealing data for monetary benefit to completly disruption the operations of a system to the extent of making entire systems inoperable. Cyber security comes in various forms and types, each being in place with the goal of protection. What makes cyber security effective is not only the technological aspect, but also the people involved. Without skilled professionals in place to implement safeguards and maintain the integrity of computer systems, companies and buisnesses would be woefully ill-equipped to combat any attacks or threats thrown their way. This is why cyber security is a very important and valuable industry in todays world, and will likely continue to be as technology continues to expand and become ever more integrated into society. </p>_**
